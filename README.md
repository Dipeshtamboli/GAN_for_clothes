<h1 align="center"> Utilizing different GANs to re-generate the clothes colour  </h1>

<h2>CycleGAN</h2>

We are using CycleGAN to generate the image of the same person with a different colour of the shirt/t-shirt.   
The training set consists of two different identities from the Market-1501 dataset.
